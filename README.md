# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly or expected behavior not occurring.  The bug is that the hover effect on the div isn't working. 
The solution is to make sure that the tailwind directives are set correctly in your postcss.config.js file.
